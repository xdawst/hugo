I am an associate researcher at the Department of Political Science at the University of Gothenburg. I completed my PhD in political science at the University of Gothenburg in February 2022.

My research interests include the dynamics of the relationship between political competition and the conduct of elections, as well as the institutional conditions associated with corruption. I study these issues using surveys and experimental methods, as well as meta-analyses and qualitative comparative analyses.

The results of my research have been published in such outlets as the International Journal of Press/Politics, Party Politics, and the Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties among others.

I am currently affiliated with the Misconduct and Whistleblowing in Political Parties project at the University of Gothenburg.
